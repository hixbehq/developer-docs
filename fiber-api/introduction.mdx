# Hixbe Fiber API

The Hixbe Fiber API provides two distinct interfaces for managing fiber internet services:

- **Consumer API**: Simple, user-friendly endpoints for residential customers to check their network status, account details, usage statistics, and run speed tests.
- **Business API**: Advanced endpoints for enterprise clients to manage IP assignments, monitor bandwidth usage, and automate network operations.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Network Monitoring**: Real-time status and configuration information
- **Usage Analytics**: Detailed bandwidth and data consumption tracking
- **Speed Testing**: Built-in speed test configuration and endpoints
- **IP Management**: Enterprise-grade IP address assignment and monitoring
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Separate consumer and business interfaces
- **High Performance**: Optimized for low-latency network operations

## 🔐 Authentication

All endpoints require Bearer token authentication. Include your JWT token in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

Tokens can be obtained from your Hixbe account dashboard.

## 📋 Versioning

All requests must include the `Hixe-Version` header with the API version date (format: YYYY-MM-DD). Current version: `2026-01-01`

```bash
Hixe-Version: 2026-01-01
```

## ⚡ Rate Limiting

- Consumer endpoints: 100 requests per minute
- Business endpoints: 1000 requests per minute

Rate limit information is included in response headers:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in current window
