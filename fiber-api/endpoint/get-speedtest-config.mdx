title: 'Get speed test configuration'
openapi: 'GET /consumer/speedtest/config'
---

Returns configuration for running speed tests against Hixbe's nearest server. The server selection is automatic based on the customer's location.

**Use Cases:**
- Implement custom speed test tools
- Verify connection performance
- Troubleshoot bandwidth issues

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use the latency endpoint for ping tests (typically 10 requests)
- Download/upload tests should run for at least 10 seconds for accuracy
- Tests should be performed during off-peak hours for best results
