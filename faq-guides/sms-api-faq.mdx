## Getting Started with SMS

### Basic SMS Sending

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I send a single SMS?">
Send a POST request to `/sms/send` with the recipient and message:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.hixbe.com/sms/send" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Hixbe-Version: 2026-01-01" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": "+1234567890",
    "message": "Hello from Hixbe!",
    "from": "YourSender"
  }'
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the maximum SMS length?">
Standard SMS allows 160 characters. Longer messages are automatically split into multiple parts (concatenated SMS).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I send SMS to multiple recipients?">
Use the bulk SMS endpoint `/sms/send-bulk` with an array of recipients:

```json
{
  "recipients": [
    {"to": "+1234567890", "message": "Personal message 1"},
    {"to": "+1234567891", "message": "Personal message 2"}
  ],
  "from": "YourSender"
}
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Sender IDs and Branding

<Accordion title="What is a sender ID?">
A sender ID is the name or number that appears as the sender of your SMS messages (e.g., "YourBrand" instead of a phone number).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I get a custom sender ID?">
Submit a sender ID request through the API or dashboard. Approval typically takes 1-2 business days and requires valid business documentation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use any sender ID?">
Sender IDs must be alphanumeric (up to 11 characters) and approved by carriers. Some countries restrict numeric-only sender IDs.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
