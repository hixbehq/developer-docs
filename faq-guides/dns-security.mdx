# DNS Security FAQ

This guide covers common questions about DNS security, encryption protocols, and best practices for securing your DNS queries.

## DNS Security Basics

### What makes DNS insecure?

Traditional DNS (port 53) sends queries in plain text, making them vulnerable to:

- **Eavesdropping**: ISPs and network operators can see all DNS queries
- **Manipulation**: DNS responses can be altered by attackers
- **Spoofing**: Fake DNS responses can redirect users to malicious sites
- **Tracking**: DNS queries can be used to track browsing habits

### What are encrypted DNS protocols?

**DNS over HTTPS (DoH):**
- Encrypts DNS queries using HTTPS
- Uses port 443 (same as web traffic)
- Provides confidentiality and integrity
- Supported by major browsers and operating systems

**DNS over TLS (DoT):**
- Encrypts DNS queries using TLS
- Uses port 853
- Provides end-to-end encryption
- Supported by most DNS clients

**DNS over QUIC (DoQ):**
- Uses QUIC protocol for encryption
- Potentially faster than DoH/DoT
- Uses port 784
- Limited client support currently

## Using Encrypted DNS

### How do I enable DoH in browsers?

**Firefox:**
1. Go to `about:config`
2. Search for `network.trr.mode`
3. Set value to `2` (for fallback) or `3` (TRR only)
4. Set `network.trr.uri` to `https://dns.hixbe.com/dns-query`

**Chrome/Chromium:**
```bash
# Launch with DoH enabled
chromium --enable-features="dns-over-https" --dns-over-https-server="https://dns.hixbe.com/dns-query"
```

**Edge:**
1. Go to Settings → Privacy, search, and services
2. Scroll to Security
3. Choose a DNS service provider or enter custom DoH server

### How do I configure DoT on different platforms?

**Linux (systemd-resolved):**
```bash
# Edit /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
[Resolve]
DNS=1.1.1.1#dns.hixbe.com
DNSOverTLS=yes
```

**Windows:**
1. Go to Settings → Network & Internet → Wi-Fi/Ethernet
2. Click on your network → Edit DNS settings
3. Select Manual → Enable DNS over HTTPS
4. Enter: `https://dns.hixbe.com/dns-query`

**macOS:**
1. Go to System Settings → Network → [Your Network]
2. Click Advanced → DNS → DNS Servers
3. Add DNS server with DoT: `1.1.1.1` (DoT enabled automatically)

### What about mobile devices?

**Android:**
1. Go to Settings → Network & internet → Advanced → Private DNS
2. Select "Private DNS provider hostname"
3. Enter: `dns.hixbe.com`

**iOS:**
1. Go to Settings → Wi-Fi → [Network Name]
2. Configure DNS → Manual
3. Add DNS server: `1.1.1.1`
4. DNS over TLS will be enabled automatically

## DNS Filtering and Security

### What is DNS-based content filtering?

DNS filtering blocks access to malicious or unwanted domains by:

- **Malware Blocking**: Prevents access to known malware distribution sites
- **Phishing Protection**: Blocks known phishing domains
- **Adult Content Filtering**: Blocks adult/pornographic content
- **Gambling Restrictions**: Blocks online gambling sites

### How does DNS filtering work?

1. **Query Interception**: DNS queries are intercepted before resolution
2. **Blocklist Checking**: Domain is checked against blocklists
3. **Response Modification**: If blocked, returns NXDOMAIN or blocked page
4. **Logging**: Blocked attempts are logged for analysis

### What are the limitations of DNS filtering?

- **Only Domain-Based**: Cannot filter content within allowed domains
- **Bypassable**: Can be circumvented using VPNs or alternative DNS
- **False Positives**: Legitimate sites may be incorrectly blocked
- **No Content Inspection**: Cannot analyze actual web content

## Best Practices

### For Personal Use

1. **Use Encrypted DNS**: Always prefer DoH or DoT over plain DNS
2. **Enable DNSSEC**: Validate DNS responses cryptographically
3. **Use Filtering**: Enable malware blocking at minimum
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep DNS configurations current

### For Organizations

1. **Implement DNS Policies**: Use different filtering levels for different users
2. **Monitor DNS Traffic**: Log and analyze DNS queries for threats
3. **Use Local DNS**: Deploy internal DNS servers with external forwarding
4. **Multi-Layer Security**: Combine DNS security with other security measures

### For Developers

1. **Handle DNS Errors**: Properly handle NXDOMAIN and other DNS errors
2. **Implement Timeouts**: Set reasonable timeouts for DNS queries
3. **Use DNS Libraries**: Prefer libraries that support encrypted DNS
4. **Monitor Resolution**: Track DNS query performance and failures

## Troubleshooting Encrypted DNS

### DoH not working

**Check browser settings:**
- Verify DoH server URL is correct
- Ensure HTTPS interception is disabled
- Check for conflicting extensions

**Network issues:**
```bash
# Test DoH connectivity
curl -I https://dns.hixbe.com/dns-query
```

### DoT connection failures

**Check port availability:**
```bash
# Test DoT port
telnet dns.hixbe.com 853
```

**Firewall configuration:**
```bash
# Linux - allow DoT
sudo ufw allow 853/tcp
```

### Certificate issues

**Certificate validation:**
```bash
# Check certificate
openssl s_client -connect dns.hixbe.com:853 -servername dns.hixbe.com
```

**Time synchronization:**
- Ensure system clock is accurate
- Use NTP servers for time synchronization

## Performance Considerations

### Does encrypted DNS slow things down?

- **Minimal Impact**: Modern encryption has negligible performance cost
- **Caching Benefits**: Encrypted DNS still benefits from caching
- **Connection Reuse**: TLS connections are reused for efficiency

### Speed comparison

| Protocol | Typical Latency | Security |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| Plain DNS | 20-50ms | None |
| DoH | 30-70ms | High |
| DoT | 25-60ms | High |
| DoQ | 20-50ms | High |

## Privacy and Legal Considerations

### What data is logged?

Our DNS service may log:
- **Query Timestamps**: When queries were made
- **Client IPs**: Source IP addresses (temporarily)
- **Query Types**: Type of DNS records requested
- **Response Codes**: Success/failure status

### Data retention

- **Temporary Logs**: Used for debugging and performance monitoring
- **Anonymization**: IPs are anonymized after 24 hours
- **No Content Storage**: Actual DNS responses are not stored
- **Compliance**: Follows privacy regulations and best practices

### Legal compliance

- **GDPR Compliant**: EU data protection regulations
- **No Tracking**: DNS queries are not used for advertising
- **Transparency**: Logging practices are documented
- **User Control**: Users can opt-out of logging

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom DNS servers

For advanced users, you can set up custom DNS configurations:

```bash
# Linux - custom resolv.conf
# /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 1.1.1.1
nameserver 1.0.0.1
options edns0

# With custom options
options timeout:2 attempts:3 rotate
```

### DNSSEC validation

Enable DNSSEC for cryptographic validation:

```bash
# Linux
# /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
DNSSEC=yes

# Test DNSSEC
dig @1.1.1.1 example.com +dnssec
```

## Common Myths

### Myth: Encrypted DNS is only for privacy

**Reality:** While privacy is important, encrypted DNS also provides:
- Protection against DNS spoofing
- Prevention of DNS hijacking
- Secure DNS in public Wi-Fi
- Compliance with security policies

### Myth: DNS filtering blocks everything

**Reality:** DNS filtering is one layer of security that should be combined with:
- Web filtering
- Endpoint protection
- User education
- Network segmentation

### Myth: Encrypted DNS is complex to set up

**Reality:** Modern operating systems and browsers make it easy:
- One-click enable in browsers
- Simple configuration in OS settings
- Automatic detection and setup
