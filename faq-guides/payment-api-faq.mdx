## Payment Processing

### How do I create a payment intent?

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Basic payment intent creation">
To create a payment intent, send a POST request to `/payment_intents` with the amount, currency, and description:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.hixbe.com/payment/payment_intents" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Hixbe-Version: 2026-01-01" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 1000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "description": "Order #12345"
  }'
```

The response includes a client secret for frontend integration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What currencies are supported?">
Hixbe supports all major currencies including USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD, and many others. The currency must be specified as a three-letter ISO code.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I handle different payment methods?">
You can accept various payment methods by creating payment methods and attaching them to payment intents or customers. Supported methods include credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Payment Confirmation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="When should I confirm a payment intent?">
Confirm the payment intent when you're ready to charge the customer. This typically happens after collecting payment details on the frontend using the client secret.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if confirmation fails?">
If confirmation fails, the payment intent status will be `requires_payment_method` or `requires_action`. Check the `last_payment_error` field for details about the failure.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I confirm payments server-side only?">
Yes, you can confirm payments entirely server-side by providing the payment method details directly in the confirmation request, though this requires PCI compliance.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Customers and Payment Methods

### Managing Customers

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="When should I create customers?">
Create customers when you need to save payment methods for future use, implement subscriptions, or track payment history for specific users.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I attach payment methods to customers?">
First create a payment method, then attach it to a customer:

```javascript
// 1. Create payment method
const paymentMethod = await api.createPaymentMethod({
  type: 'card',
  card: { number, exp_month, exp_year, cvc }
});

// 2. Attach to customer
await api.attachPaymentMethodToCustomer(customerId, paymentMethod.id);
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can customers have multiple payment methods?">
Yes, customers can have multiple saved payment methods. You can list them and set a default payment method for easier checkout.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Refunds and Disputes

### Processing Refunds

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I process a refund?">
Create a refund by providing the payment intent ID and optionally the amount to refund:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.hixbe.com/payment/refunds" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Hixbe-Version: 2026-01-01" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "payment_intent": "pi_1234567890",
    "amount": 500
  }'
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I refund partial amounts?">
Yes, you can refund any amount up to the original payment amount. Multiple partial refunds are allowed as long as the total doesn't exceed the original payment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long do refunds take?">
Refunds typically process within 5-10 business days, depending on the customer's bank and payment method. You'll receive webhook notifications when the refund completes.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Webhooks and Events

### Payment Webhooks

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What webhook events should I listen for?">
Essential events to monitor:
- `payment_intent.succeeded` - Payment completed successfully
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Payment failed
- `payment_intent.canceled` - Payment was canceled
- `refund.succeeded` - Refund processed
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I handle webhook retries?">
Hixbe automatically retries failed webhooks. Implement idempotency using event IDs to handle duplicate events safely.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I test webhooks?">
Yes, use the dashboard to send test webhook events to your endpoints during development.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security and Compliance

### PCI Compliance

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How does Hixbe handle PCI compliance?">
Hixbe is PCI DSS Level 1 compliant. When using our hosted payment forms, sensitive card data never touches your servers, reducing your PCI scope.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I need to handle card data directly?">
If you must handle card data server-side, you'll need full PCI compliance. We recommend using our client-side integration instead.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are payment methods tokenized?">
Yes, all payment methods are tokenized. We never store raw card numbers - only tokens that can be used for future payments.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Testing and Sandbox

### Sandbox Environment

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I test payments?">
Use our sandbox environment at `https://sandbox.api.hixbe.com`. Use test API keys and test card numbers like `4242 4242 4242 4242`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What test cards are available?">
- `4242 4242 4242 4242` - Succeeds
- `4000 0000 0000 0002` - Declined
- `4000 0025 0000 3155` - Requires authentication
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do sandbox payments appear in production?">
No, sandbox and production are completely separate environments. Test data never affects live payments.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Error Handling

### Common Payment Errors

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="CARD_DECLINED - What does this mean?">
The customer's card was declined by their bank. Common reasons include insufficient funds, expired card, or bank restrictions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS - How to handle?">
The account doesn't have enough funds. Ask the customer to use a different payment method or add funds to their account.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="PAYMENT_INTENT_EXPIRED - What happened?">
Payment intents expire after 24 hours by default. Create a new payment intent for the customer to try again.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration Best Practices

### Performance and Reliability

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I handle rate limits?">
Monitor the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header and implement exponential backoff when approaching limits. Payment API allows 100 requests per minute.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Should I use idempotency keys?">
Yes, always use idempotency keys for payment operations to prevent duplicate charges if requests are retried.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I implement proper error handling?">
Check the `success` field in all responses. Handle different error codes appropriately and provide meaningful feedback to users.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Billing and Pricing

### Understanding Costs

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How am I charged for payments?">
You pay a percentage of each successful transaction plus a fixed fee per transaction. Check your dashboard for current pricing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there fees for refunds?">
Refunds may incur processing fees depending on your pricing plan. Failed payments don't incur transaction fees.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I monitor my usage?">
Use the dashboard to track transaction volume, success rates, and costs in real-time.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
