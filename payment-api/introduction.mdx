title: Hixbe Payment API Introduction
description: Hixbe Payment API - A developer-first REST API for a modern payment gateway
---

> **Note**: This API is focused on predictable semantics, idempotency, clear errors, and observability.

## Overview

The Hixbe Payment API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for handling payments, customers, payment methods, refunds, and webhooks. All amounts are in smallest currency unit (e.g., paisa for BDT).

## Authentication

All requests require Bearer token authentication:

```
Authorization: Bearer <sk_...>
```

## Base URLs

- Sandbox: `https://sandbox.api.hixbe.com/payment`
- Production: `https://api.hixbe.com/payment`

## Versioning

API versioning is handled via the `Hixbe-Version` header. Use `2026-01-01` for the latest version.

Include this header in all API requests:

```
Hixbe-Version: 2026-01-01
```

## Key Concepts

### Payment Intents
The recommended pattern for collecting payments. Create an intent, attach a payment method, and confirm to complete the payment.

### Payment Methods
Tokenized payment instruments that can be attached to customers or used directly.

### Customers
Store customer information and associate payment methods for recurring payments.

### Refunds
Issue full or partial refunds for completed charges.

### Webhooks
Receive real-time notifications about payment events.

## Error Handling

All errors follow a consistent format with `type`, `code`, `message`, and optional `param` and `request_id` fields.

## Idempotency

Use the `Idempotency-Key` header for safe retries of POST requests.
