## Overview

The Hixbe Certification & Badge API enables you to create, issue, verify, and manage digital certificates and badges. Perfect for educational institutions, certification bodies, and organizations needing to issue verifiable credentials.

## Authentication

All requests require Bearer token authentication:

```

```

## Base URLs

## Versioning

API versioning is handled via the `Hixbe-Version` header. Use `2026-01-01` for the latest version.

Include this header in all API requests:

```
Hixbe-Version: 2026-01-01
```
